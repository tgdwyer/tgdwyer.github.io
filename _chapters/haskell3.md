title: "Functor and Applicative"
---

In this chapter we see how the Haskell language features we introduced in previous chapters (from function application rules based on [Lambda Calculus](/lambdacalculus) to [Typeclasses](/haskell2#typeclasses)) lead to highly flexible and refactorable code and powerful abstractions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how [eta-conversion](#eta-conversion), [operator sectioning](#operator-sectioning) and [compose](#compose), together provide the ability to transform code to achieve a composable [point free](#point-free-code) form and use this technique to refactor code.
- Understand that in Haskell the ability to map over container structures is generalised into the [Functor](#functor) typeclass, such that any type that is an instance of Functor has the `fmap` or `(<$>)` operation.
- Understand that the [Applicative Typeclass](#applicative) extends Functor such that containers of functions may be applied (using the `(<*>)` operator) to containers of values.
- Understand that Functor and Applicative allow powerful composable types through exploring a [simple applicative functor for parsing](#a-simple-applicative-functor-for-parsing).

## Refactoring Cheatsheet

The following equivalences make many refactorings possible in Haskell:

### Eta Conversion
Exactly as per [Lambda Calculus](/lambdacalculus):
```haskell
 f x ≡ g x
 f   ≡ g
```

### Operator Sectioning

Remember haskell binary operators are just infix curried functions of two parameters and that putting brackets around them makes them prefix instead of infix.

```haskell
 x + y ≡ (+) x y
       ≡ ((+) x) y  -- making function application precedence explicit
       ≡ (x+) y     -- binary operators can also be partially applied
```
Such operator sectioning allows us to get the right-most parameter of the function on it's own at the right-hand side of the body expression such that we can apply Eta conversion, thus:
```haskell
f x = 1 + x
f x = (1+) x
f = (1+)             -- Eta conversion
```

### Compose

Has its own operator in haskell `(.)`, inspired by the mathematical function composition symbol `∘`:
```haskell
 (f ∘ g) (x) ≡ f (g(x)) -- math notation
 (f . g) x ≡ f (g x)    -- Haskell
```
Again, this gives us another way to get the right-most parameter on its own outside the body expression:
```haskell
f x = sqrt (1 / x)
f x = sqrt ((1/) x)     -- operator section
f x = (sqrt . (1/)) x   -- by the definition of composition
f = sqrt . (1/)         -- eta conversion
```

</div>

## Point-Free Code

We have discussed point-free and tacit coding style earlier in these notes. In particular, eta-conversion works in Haskell the same as in lambda calculus and for curried JavaScript functions.  It is easy to do and usually declutters code of unnecessary arguments, e.g.:

```haskell
lessThan :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a]
lessThan n aList = filter (<n) aList
```

The following is more concise, and once you are used to reading haskell type definitions, just as self evident:

```haskell
lessThan :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a]
lessThan n = filter (<n)
```

But the above still has an argument (a point), `n`.  Can we go further?

It is possible to be more aggressive in refactoring code to achieve point-free style by using the compose operator `(.)`:

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(f . g) x = f (g x)
```

To see how to use `(.)` in `lessThan` we need to refactor it to look like the right-hand side of the definition above, i.e. `f (g x)`.  For `lessThan`, this takes a couple of steps, because the order we pass arguments to `(<)` matters.  Partially applying infix operators like `(<n)` is called operator sectioning.  Placing `n` after `<` means that it is being passed as the second argument to the operator, which is inconvenient for eta-conversion.  Observe that `(<n)` is equivalent to `(n>)`, so the following is equivalent to the definition above:

```haskell
lessThan n = filter (n>)
```

Now we can use the non-infix form of (>):
```haskell
lessThan n = filter ((>) n)
```

And we see from [our definition of compose](#compose), that if we were to replace filter by `f`, `(>)` by `g`, and `n` by `x`, we would have exactly the definition of `(.)`.  Thus,

```haskell
lessThan n = (filter . (>)) n
```

And now we can apply [eta-conversion](#eta-conversion):

```haskell
lessThan = filter . (>)
```

Between operator sectioning, the compose combinator `(.)`, and eta-conversion it is possible to write many functions in point-free form.  For example, the flip combinator:

```haskell
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
flip f a b = f b a
```

can also be useful in reversing the arguments of a function or operator in order to get them into a position such that they can be eta-reduced.
  
In code written by experienced haskellers it is very common to see functions reduced to point-free form.  Does it make code more readable?  To experienced haskellers, many times yes.  To novices, perhaps not.  When to do it is a matter of preference.  Experienced haskellers tend to prefer it, they will argue that it reduces functions like the example one above “to their essence”, removing the “unnecessary plumbing” of explicitly named variables.   Whether you like it or not, it is worth being familiar with the tricks above, because you will undoubtedly see them used in practice.  The other place where point-free style is very useful is when you would otherwise need to use a lambda function.

Some more (and deeper) discussion is available on the Haskell Wiki.

### Exercises

* Refactor the following function to be point-free:

```haskell
f a b c = (a+b)*c
```

(This is clearly an extreme example but is a useful -- and easily verified -- practice of operator sectioning, composition and eta-conversion.)

## Functor

We’ve been mapping over lists and arrays many times, first in JavaScript:

```javascript
console> [1,2,3].map(x=>x+1)
[2,3,4]
```

Now in Haskell:

```haskell
GHCi> map (\i->i+1) [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
```

Or (eta-reduce the lambda to be point-free):

```haskell
GHCi> map (+1) [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
```

Here’s the implementation of `map` for lists as it’s [defined in the GHC standard library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#map):

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

It’s easy to generalise this pattern to any data structure that holds one or more values: mapping a function over a data structure creates a new data structure whose elements are the result of applying the function to the elements of the original data structure.

In Haskell this pattern is captured in a type class called `Functor`, which defines a function called `fmap`.

```haskell
Prelude> :i Functor
type Functor :: (* -> *) -> Constraint
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
...
instance Functor [] -- naturally lists are an instance
instance Functor Maybe -- but this may surprise!
... -- and some other instances we'll talk about shortly
```

The first line says that an instances of the Functor typeclass `f` must be over a type that has the [kind](/haskell2#type-kinds) `(* -> *)`, that is, their constructors must be parameterised with a single type variable.  After this, the `class` definition specifies `fmap` as a function that will be available to any instance of Functor and that `f` is the type parameter for the constructor function, which again, takes one type parameter, e.g. `f a` as the input to `fmap`, which returns an `f b`.

Naturally, lists have an instance:

```haskell
Prelude> :i []
...
instance Functor [] -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
```

We can actually look up GHC’s implementation of `fmap` for lists and we see:

```haskell
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
```

And here’s the instance for `Maybe`:

```haskell
instance  Functor Maybe  where
    fmap _ Nothing       = Nothing
    fmap f (Just a)      = Just (f a)
```

So we can `fmap` a function over a Maybe without having to unpack it:
```haskell
GHCi> fmap (+1) (Just 6)
Just 7 
```

This is such a common operation that there is an operator alias for fmap: `<$>`
```haskell
GHCi> (+1) <$> (Just 6)
Just 7 
```

Which also works over lists:
```haskell
GHCi> (+1) <$> [1,2,3]
[2,3,4] 
```

Lists of `Maybe`s frequently arise.  For example, the `mod` operation on integers (e.g. `mod 3 2 == 1`) will throw an error if you pass 0 as the divisor:
```haskell
> mod 3 0
*** Exception: divide by zero 
```

We might define a safe modulo function:
```haskell
safeMod :: Integral a => a-> a-> Maybe a
safeMod _ 0 = Nothing
safeMod numerator divisor = Just $ mod numerator divisor 
```

This makes it safe to apply `safeMod` to an arbitrary list of `Integral` values:
```haskell
> map (safeMod 3) [1,2,0,4]
[Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3] 
```

But how do we keep working with such a list of `Maybe`s?  We can map an `fmap` over the list:

```haskell
GHCi> map ((+1) <$>) [Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3]
[Just 1,Just 2,Nothing,Just 4] 
```

Or equivalently:
```haskell
GHCi> ((+1) <$>) <$> [Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3]
[Just 1,Just 2,Nothing,Just 4] 
```

In addition to lists and `Maybe`s, a number of other built-in types have instances of `Functor`:

```haskell
GHCi> :i Functor
...
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in `Data.Either'
instance Functor IO -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
instance Functor ((->) r) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in `GHC.Base' 
```

The definition for functions `(->)` might surprise:
```haskell
instance Functor ((->) r) where
    fmap = (.) 
```

So the composition of functions `f` and `g`, `f . g`, is equivalent to ‘mapping’ `f` over `g`, e.g.  `f <$> g`.  

```haskell
GHCi> f = (+1)
GHCi> g = (*2)
GHCi> (f.g) 3
7
GHCi> (f<$>g) 3
7
```

### Functor Laws

We can formalise the definition of Functor with two laws:

The law of ***identity*** 

∀ x: (id <$> x) ≡ x 

The law of ***composition***

∀ f, g, x: (f ∘ g <$> x) ≡ (f <$> (g <$> x)) 

Note that these laws are not enforced by the compiler when you create your own instances of `Functor`.  You’ll need to test them for yourself.  Following these laws guarantees that general code (e.g. algorithms) using `fmap` will also work for your own instances of `Functor`.

Let's make a custom instance of `Functor` for a simple binary tree type and check that the laws hold.  Here's a simple binary tree datatype:

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty
            | Leaf a
            | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show)
```

Note that `Leaf` is a bit redundant as we could also encode nodes with no children as `Node Empty value Empty` -- but that's kind of ugly and makes showing our trees more verbose.  Also, having both `Leaf` and `Empty` provides a nice parallel to `Maybe`.

Here's an example tree defined:

```haskell
tree = Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7))
```
And here's a visualisation of the tree:
```
Node 4
 ├──Node 2
 |   ├──Leaf 1
 |   └──Leaf 3
 └──Node 6
     ├──Leaf 5
     └──Leaf 7
```

And here's the instance of `Functor` for `Tree` that defines `fmap`.  

```haskell
instance Functor Tree where
   fmap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
   fmap _ Empty = Empty
   fmap f (Leaf v) = Leaf $ f v
   fmap f (Node l v r) = Node (fmap f l) (f v) (fmap f r)
```

Just as in the `Maybe` instance above, we use pattern matching to define a case for each possible constructor in the ADT.  The `Empty` and `Leaf` cases are very similar to `Maybe` `fmap` for `Nothing` and `Just` respectively, that is,
for `Empty` we just return another `Empty`, for `Leaf` we return a new `Leaf` containing the application of `f` to the value `x` stored in the leaf.  The fun one is `Node`.  As for `Leaf`, `fmap f` of a `Node` returns a new `Node` whose own value is the result of applying `f` to the value stored in the input `Node`, but the left and right children of the new node will be the recursive application of `fmap f` to the children of the input node.

Now we'll demonstrate (but not prove) that the two laws hold at least for our example tree:

Law of Identity:

```haskell
> id <$> tree
Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7))
```

Law of Composition:

```haskell
> (+1) <$> (*2) <$> tree
Node (Node (Leaf 3) 5 (Leaf 7)) 9 (Node (Leaf 11) 13 (Leaf 15))
> (+1).(*2) <$> tree
Node (Node (Leaf 3) 5 (Leaf 7)) 9 (Node (Leaf 11) 13 (Leaf 15))
```

## Applicative

The typeclass `Applicative` introduces a new operator `<*>` (pronounced “apply”), which lets us apply functions inside a computational context.

Applicative is a “subclass” of `Functor`, meaning that an instance of `Applicative` can be `fmap`ed over, but Applicatives also declare (at least) two additional functions, `pure` and `(<*>)` (pronounced ‘apply’ -- but I like calling it [“TIE Fighter”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter)):

```haskell
GHCi> :i Applicative
class Functor f => Applicative (f :: * -> *) where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
...
```

As for `Functor` all instances of the Applicative type-class must satisfy certain laws, which again are not checked by the compiler.
Applicative instances must comply with these laws to produce the expected behaviour.
You can [read about the Applicative Laws](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_functors)
if you are interested, but they are a little more subtle than the basic Functor laws above, and it is
not essential to understand them to be able to use `<*>` in Haskell.

As for `Functor`, many Base Haskell types are also `Applicative`, e.g. `[]`, `Maybe`, `IO` and `(->)`.

For example, a function inside a `Maybe` can be applied to a value in a `Maybe`.

```haskell
GHCi> Just (+3) <*> Just 2
Just 5 
```

Or a list of functions `[(+1),(+2)]` to things inside a similar context (e.g. a list `[1,2,3]`).
```haskell
> [(+1),(+2)] <*> [1,2,3]
[2,3,4,3,4,5] 
```

Note that lists definition of `<*>` produces the Cartesian product of the two lists, that is, all the possible ways to apply the functions in the left list to the values in the right list.  It is interesting to look at [the source](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#Applicative) for the definition of `Applicative` for lists on Hackage:

```haskell
instance Applicative [] where
  pure x    = [x]
  fs <*> xs = [f x | f <- fs, x <- xs]  -- list comprehension 
```

The definition of `<*>` for lists uses a list comprehension.  List comprehensions are a short-hand way to generate lists, using notation similar to mathematical ["set builder notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation).  The set builder notation here would be:  `{f(x) |  f ∈ fs ∧ x ∈ xs}`.  In English it means: “the set (Haskell list) of all functions in `fs` applied to all values in `xs`”. 


A common use-case for Applicative is applying a binary (two-parameter) function over two Applicative values, e.g.:

```haskell
> pure (+) <*> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just 5 
```

So:
- `pure` puts the binary function into the applicative (i.e. `pure (+) :: Maybe (Num -> Num -> Num)`), 
- then `<*>`ing this function inside over the first `Maybe` value `Just 3` achieves a partial application of the function inside the `Maybe`. This gives a unary function inside a `Maybe`: i.e. `Just (3+) :: Maybe (Num->Num)`. 
- Finally, we `<*>` this function inside a `Maybe` over the remaining `Maybe` value.

This is where the name "applicative" comes from, i.e. `Applicative` is a type over which a non-unary function may be applied.  Note, that the following use of `<$>` (infix `fmap`) is equivalent and a little bit more concise:

```haskell
> (+) <$> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just 5 
```

This is also called “lifting” a function over an Applicative.  Actually, it’s so common that Applicative also defines dedicated functions for lifting binary functions (in the GHC.Base module):

```haskell
> GHC.Base.liftA2 (+) (Just 3) (Just 2)
Just 5 
```

Here's a little visual summary of Applicative and lifting (box metaphor inspired by [adit.io](http://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)):

![Applicative Visual Summary](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell3/applicativePicture.png)

It’s also useful to lift binary data constructors over two Applicative values, e.g. for tuples:
```haskell
> (,) <$> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just (3, 2) 
```

We can equally well apply functions with more than two arguments over the correct number of values inside Applicative contexts.
Recall our student data type:

```haskell
data Student = Student { id::Integer, name::String, mark::Int } 
```

with a ternary constructor:

```haskell
Student::Integer -> String -> Int -> Student
```

Let's say we want to create a student for a given `id` but we need to look up the name and mark from tables, i.e. lists of key-value pairs: 
`names::[(Integer,String)]` and `marks::[(Integer,Int)]`.  We'll use the function `lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b`, which will either succeed with `Just` the result, or fail to find the value for a given key, and return `Nothing`.

```haskell
lookupStudent :: Integer -> Maybe Student
lookupStudent sid = Student sid <$> lookup sid names <*> lookup sid marks
```

<!-- The following example doesn't typecheck. Commented it out for now.

What if `sid` is also the result of some computation that may fail, and is therefore itself wrapped in a `Maybe` context?  Then we will need to apply the ternary `Student` constructor over three `Maybe`s:

```haskell
lookupStudent :: Maybe Integer -> Maybe Student
lookupStudent sid = Student <$> sid <*> lookup sid names <*> lookup sid marks
```

So we can see `<*>` may be chained as many times as necessary to cover all the arguments.
-->

Lists are also instances of `Applicative`.  Given the following types:

```haskell
data Suit = Spade|Club|Diamond|Heart
 deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Bounded)

instance Show Suit where
 show Spade = "^"     -- ♠	 (closest I could come in ASCII was ^)
 show Club = "&"      -- ♣
 show Diamond = "O"   -- ♦
 show Heart = "V"     -- ♥

data Rank = Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|Ten|Jack|Queen|King|Ace
 deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Show,Bounded)

data Card = Card Suit Rank
 deriving (Eq, Ord, Show) 
```

We can make one card using the Card constructor:

```haskell
GHCi> Card Spade Ace
Card ^ Ace 
```

Or, since both `Suit` and `Rank` derive `Enum`, we can enumerate the full lists of `Suit`s and `Rank`s, and then lift the `Card` operator over both lists to create a whole deck:

```haskell
GHCi> Card <$> [Spade ..] <*> [Two ..]
[Card ^ Two,Card ^ Three,Card ^ Four,Card ^ Five,Card ^ Six,Card ^ Seven,Card ^ Eight,Card ^ Nine,Card ^ Ten,Card ^ Jack,Card ^ Queen,Card ^ King,Card ^ Ace,Card & Two,Card & Three,Card & Four,Card & Five,Card & Six,Card & Seven,Card & Eight,Card & Nine,Card & Ten,Card & Jack,Card & Queen,Card & King,Card & Ace,Card O Two,Card O Three,Card O Four,Card O Five,Card O Six,Card O Seven,Card O Eight,Card O Nine,Card O Ten,Card O Jack,Card O Queen,Card O King,Card O Ace,Card V Two,Card V Three,Card V Four,Card V Five,Card V Six,Card V Seven,Card V Eight,Card V Nine,Card V Ten,Card V Jack,Card V Queen,Card V King,Card V Ace] 
```

#### Exercise

* Create instances of `Show` for `Rank` and `Card` such that a deck of cards displays much more succinctly, e.g.: 
```
[^2,^3,^4,^5,^6,^7,^8,^9,^10,^J,^Q,^K,^A,&2,&3,&4,&5,&6,&7,&8,&9,&10,&J,&Q,&K,&A,O2,O3,O4,O5,O6,O7,O8,O9,O10,OJ,OQ,OK,OA,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6,V7,V8,V9,V10,VJ,VQ,VK,VA]
```

* Try and make the definition of `show` for `Rank` a one-liner using `zip` and `lookup`.

### Different Ways To Apply Functions Cheatsheet

```haskell
 g x         -- apply function g to argument x
 g $ x       -- apply function g to argument x
 g <$> f x   -- apply function g to argument x which is inside Functor f
 f g <*> f x -- apply function g in Applicative context f to argument x which is also inside f
```
</div>

We saw that functions `(->)` are Functors, such that `(<$>)=(.)`.  There is also an instance of Applicative for functions of input type `r`.  We'll give the types of the essential functions for the instance:

```haskell
instance Applicative ((->)r) where
  pure :: a -> (r->a)
  (<*>) :: (r -> (a -> b)) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)
```

This is very convenient for creating point-free implementations of functions which operate on their parameters more than once.  For example, imagine our `Student` type from above has additional fields with breakdowns of marks: e.g. `exam` and `nonExam`, requiring a function to compute the total mark:

```haskell
totalMark :: Student -> Int
totalMark s = exam s + nonExam s
```

Here's the point-free version, taking advantage of the fact that `exam` and `nonExam`, both being functions of the same input type `Student`, are both in the same Applicative context:

```haskell
totalMark = (+) <$> exam <*> nonExam
```

Or equivalently:

```haskell
totalMark = (+) . exam <*> nonExam
```

---------

### Exercise

- derive the implementations of `pure` and `<*>` for `Maybe` and for functions `((->)r)`.

(hint, if you get stuck there are spoilers in the source from GHC.Base that I linked above)

------------


## Alternative 

The Alternative typeclass is another important typeclass in Haskell, which is closely related to the Applicative typeclass. It introduces a set of operators and functions that are particularly useful when dealing with computations that can fail or have multiple possible outcomes. Alternative is also considered a "subclass" of Applicative, and it provides additional capabilities beyond what Applicative offers. It introduces two main functions, `empty` and `(<|>)` (pronounced "alt" or "alternative")

```haskell
class Applicative f => Alternative (f :: * -> *) where
  empty :: f a
  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
```

`empty`: This function represents a computation with *no result or a failure*. It serves as the identity element. For different data types that are instances of Alternative, empty represents an empty container or a *failed computation*, depending on the context.

`(<|>)`: The `<|>` operator combines two computations, and it's used to express alternatives. It takes two computations of the same type and returns a computation that will produce a result from the first computation if it succeeds, or if it fails, it will produce a result from the second computation. This operator allows you to handle branching logic and alternative paths in your code.

Like Functor and Applicative, instances of the Alternative typeclass must also adhere to specific laws, ensuring predictable behavior when working with alternatives. Common instances of the Alternative typeclass include Maybe and lists ([]). Alternatives are also very useful for *Parsers*, where we try to run first parser, if it fails, we run the second parser. 

```haskell
> Just 2 <|> Just 5
Just 2

> Nothing <|> Just 5
Just 5
```

## A simple Applicative Functor for Parsing

As we will [discuss in more detail later](/parsercombinators), a parser is a program which takes some structured input and does something with it.  When we say "structured input" we typically mean something like a string that follows strict rules about its syntax, like source code in a particular programming language, or a file format like JSON.  A parser for a given syntax is a program which you run over some input and if the input is valid, it will do something sensible with it (like give us back some data), or fail: preferrably in a way that we can handle gracefully.  

In Haskell, sophisticated parsers are often constructed from simple functions which try to read a certain element of the expected input and either succeed in consuming that input, returning a tuple containing the rest of the input string and the resultant data, or they fail producing nothing.  We've already seen one type which can be used to encode success or failure, namely `Maybe`.  Here's the most trivial parser function I can think of. It tries to take a character from the input stream and either succeeds consuming it or fails if it's given an empty string:

```haskell
-- >>> parseChar "abc"
-- Just ("bc",'a')
-- >>> parseChar ""
-- Nothing
parseChar :: String -> Maybe (String, Char)
parseChar "" = Nothing
parseChar (c:rest) = Just (rest, c)
```

And here's one to parse `Int`s off the input stream.  It uses the `reads` function from the Prelude:

```haskell
-- >>> parseInt "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",123)
-- >>> parseInt "xyz456"
-- Nothing
parseInt :: String -> Maybe (String, Int) 
parseInt s = case reads s of     
  [(x, rest)] -> Just (rest, x)
  _           -> Nothing
```

So now we could combine these to try to build a little calculator language (OK, all it can do is add two integers, but you get the idea):

```haskell
-- >>> parsePlus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
parsePlus :: String -> Maybe (String, Int)
parsePlus s =
    case parseInt s of
        Just (s', x) -> case parseChar s' of
            Just (s'', '+') -> case parseInt s'' of
                Just (s''',y) -> Just (s''',x+y)
                Nothing -> Nothing
            Nothing -> Nothing
        Nothing -> Nothing
```

But that's not very elegant and Haskell is all about elegant simplicity.  So how can we use Haskell's typeclass system to make parsers that are more easily combined?  We've seen how things that are instances of the `Functor` and `Applicative` typeclasses can be combined -- so let's make a type definition for parsers and then make it an instance of `Functor` and `Applicative`.  Here's a generic type for parsers:

```haskell
newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> Maybe (String, a))
```

We can now make concrete parsers for `Int` and `Char` using our previous functions:
```haskell
char :: Parser Char
char = Parser parseChar
int :: Parser Int
int = Parser parseInt
```

And here's a generic function we can use to run these parsers:

```haskell
-- >>> parse int "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",123)
parse :: Parser a -> String -> Maybe (String, a)
parse (Parser p) = p
```

And here's a little parser which asserts the next character on the stream is the one we are expecting:

```haskell
-- >>> parse (is '+') "+456"
-- Just ("456",'+')
-- >>> parse (is '-') "+456"
-- Nothing
is :: Char -> Parser Char
is c = Parser $ \i -> case parse char i of
    Just (r1, x) -> if x == c then Just (r1, x) else Nothing
    Nothing      -> Nothing
```

By making `Parser` an instance of `Functor` we will be able to map functions over the result of a parse.

What the `Functor` instance of a parser should do is apply the parser and apply a function to the result of the parse.

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (\x -> case a x of 
      Just (rest, result) -> Just (rest, f result)
      Nothing -> Nothing)
```

That solution should not be too hard. We apply the parser and if it passes (equates to a `Just`) we call the function `f` on the `result`.

However, what we are doing is applying a function to the second item of a tuple -- that is exactly what the `Functor` instance of a tuple does! So we can rewrite that like this

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (\x -> case a x of 
      Just (rest, result) -> Just (f <$> (rest, result))
      Nothing -> Nothing)
```
Carefully examining this, what we are doing is applying `(f <$>)` if the result is a `Just`, and ignoring if the result if `Nothing`. This is exactly what the Maybe instance of a `Functor` does! So we can make use of that!

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (\x -> (f <$>) <$> a x )
```

Let's try to remove the lambda function by applying the [point-free](/haskell3/#point-free-code) techniques to remove this lambda function. 

First, let's add some brackets, to make the evaluation order more explicit.
```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (\x -> ((f <$>) <$>) (a x))
```
This is now in the form  `(f . g) x)` where `f` is equal to `((f <$>) <$>)` and g is equal to `a`. Therefore:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (\x -> (((f <$>) <$>) . a) x)
```

And, if we eta-reduce:
```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (((f <$>) <$>) . a)
```

The last thing we notice is that the `Functor` instance for functions is defined as compose. Therefore, we have finally reached the end of our journey and can re-write this as follows.
```haskell
-- >>> parse ((*2) <$> int) "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",246)
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser a) = Parser (((f <$>) <$>) <$> a)
```

The whacky triple-nested application of `<$>` comes about because the `a` in our `Parser` type is nested inside a Tuple (`(,a)`), nested inside a `Maybe`, nested inside function (`->r`).  So now we can map (or `fmap`, to be precise) a function over the value produced by a `Parser`.  For example:

```haskell
> parse ((+1)<$>int) "1bc"
Just ("bc",2)
```

Another way to think of `(+1)<$>int` is that we are creating a new `Parser` which parses an `int` from the input stream and adds one to the value parsed (if it succeeds).

Just as we have seen before, making our `Parser` an instance of `Applicative` is going to let us do nifty things like lifting a binary function over the results of two `Parser`s.  For example, instead of implementing all the messy logic of connecting two Parsers to make `plus` above, we'll be able to lift `(+)` over two `Parser`s.

Now the definition for the `Applicative` is going to stitch together all the messy bits of handling both the `Just` and `Nothing` cases of the `Maybe` that we saw above in the definition of `plus`, abstracting it out so that people implementing parsers like `plus` won't have to:


```haskell
instance Applicative Parser where
  pure a = Parser (\b -> Just (b, a))

  (Parser f) <*> (Parser b) = Parser $ \i -> case f i of  -- note that this is just
    Just (r1, p1) -> case b r1 of                         -- an abstraction of the
      Just (r2, p2) -> Just (r2, p1 p2)                   -- logic we saw in `plus`
      Nothing       -> Nothing
    Nothing -> Nothing
```

All that `pure` does is to leave the input unchanged and put the given value on the right side of the tuple.

The key insight for this applicative instance is that we first use `f` (the parser on the LHS of `<*>`). This consumes input from `i` giving back the remaining input in `r1`. We then run the second parser `b` on the RHS of `<*>` on `r1` (the remaining input). 

The main take-away message is that `<*>` allows us to combine two parsers in sequence, that is, we can run the first one and then the second one. 

Let's walk through a concrete example of this. 

```haskell
> add1Parser = (,) <$> char <*> int
> parse add1Parser "a12345b"
Just ("b",('a',12345))
```

As both `<$>` and `<*>` have the same precedence, firstly `(,) <$> char` will be evaluated, the result will be then applied to `int`.

So how does `(,) <$> char` work? Well, we parse a character and then make that character the first item of a tuple, therefore:
```haskell
> tupleCharParser = (,) <$> char
> :t tupleCharParser
tupleCharParser :: Parser (b -> (Char, b))
```
So for the applicative instance the LHS will be the `tupleCharParser` and the RHS will be `int`.

The first step in applicative parsing is to parse the input `i` using the LHS parser, in this case `tupleCharParser`
This will match the `Just (r1, p1)` case where it will be equal to `Just ("12345b", ('a',))`. Therefore, `r1` is equal to the unparsed portion of the input `12345b` and the result is a tuple partially applied `('a', )`.

We then run the second parser `int` on the remaining input `"12345b"`. This will match the `Just (r2, p2)` case where it will be equal to `Just ("b", 12345)`, where `r2` is equal to the remaining input `"b"` and `p2` is equal to `"12345"`

We then return `Just (r2, p1 p2)`, which will evaluate to `Just ("b", ('a',12345))`. 


Using the `<*>` operator we can make our calculator magnificently simple:

```haskell
-- >>> parse plus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
plus :: Parser Int
plus = (+) <$> int <*> (is '+' *> int)

```

Note that we make use of a different version of the applicative operator here: `*>`.  Note also that we didn't have to provide an implementation of `*>` - rather, the typeclass system picks up a default implementation of this operator (and a bunch of other functions too) from the base definition of `Applicative`.  These default implementations are able to make use of the `<*>` that we did provide for our instance of Applicative for Parser.

```haskell
Prelude> :t (*>)                        
(*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b
```

So compared to `<*>` which took a function inside the `Applicative` as its first parameter which is applied to the value inside the `Applicative` of its second parameter,
the `*>` carries through the effect of the first `Applicative`, but doesn't do anything else with the value.  You can think of it as a simple chaining of effectful operations: "do the first effectful thing, then do the second effectful thing, but give back the result of the second thing only".

In the context of the `Parser` instance when we do things like `(is '+' *> int)`, we try the `is`.  If it succeeds then we carry on and run the `int`.  But if the `is` fails, execution is short circuited and we return `Nothing`.  There is also a flipped version of the operator which works the other way:

 ```haskell
Prelude> :t (<*)                        
(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
```

So we could have just as easily implement the `plus` parser:

```haskell
-- >>> parse plus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
plus :: Parser Int
plus = (+) <$> int <* is '+'  <*> int

```

Obviously, the above is not a fully featured parsing system.  A real parser would need to give us more information in the case of failure, so a `Maybe` is not really a sufficiently rich type to package the result.  Also, a real language would need to be able to handle alternatives - e.g. `minus` or `plus`, as well as expressions with an arbitrary number of terms.  We will revisit all of these topics with a more feature rich set of [parser combinators later](/parsercombinators).

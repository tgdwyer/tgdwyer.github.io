title: "Foldable and Traversable"
---

In this chapter we will meet some more typeclasses that abstract common coding patterns for dealing with data.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand that the “reduce” function we met for arrays and other data structures in JavaScript is referred to as [“folding”](/haskell4/#folds) in Haskell and there are two variants `foldl` and `foldr` for left and right folds respectively.
- Understand that the [Monoid](#monoid) typeclass for things that have a predefined rule for aggregation (concatenation), making containers of `Monoid` values trivial to `fold`
- Understand that [Foldable](#foldable) generalises containers that may be folded (or reduced) into values
- Understand that [Traversable](#traversable) generalises containers over which we can traverse applying a function with an Applicative effect

## Folds

Recall the “`reduce`” function that is a member of JavaScript’s `Array` type, and which we implemented ourselves for linked and cons lists, was a way to generalise loops over enumerable types.
In Haskell, this concept is once again generalised with a typeclass called `Foldable` -- the class of things which can be “folded” over to produce a single value.  
We will come back to [the `Foldable` typeclass](#foldable), but first let’s limit our conversation to the familiar `Foldable` instance, basic lists.  
Although in JavaScript `reduce` always associates elements from left to right, Haskell’s `Foldable` typeclass offers both `foldl` (which folds left-to-right) and `foldr` (which folds right-to-left):

```haskell
Prelude> :t foldl
foldl :: Foldable t => (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b

Prelude> :t foldr
foldr :: Foldable t => (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b
```

In the following the examples the `Foldable t` instance is a list. Here’s how we right-fold over a list to sum its elements:

![Left Fold](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell4/rightFold.png)

While the lambda above makes it explicit which parameter is the accumulator and which is the list element, this is a classic example where point-free coding style makes this expression very succinct:

```haskell
Prelude> foldr (+) 0 [5,8,3,1,7,6,2]
```

> 32

Here’s a left fold with a picture of the fold:

![Left Fold](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell4/leftFold.png)

Note that since the `(+)` operator is associative -- a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c -- `foldr` and `foldl` return the same result.  For functions that are not associative, however, this is not necessarily the case.

---

### Exercises

- Predict what the results of a left- and right-fold will be for `(-)` folded over `[1,2,3,4]` with initial value `0`.
- What is the result of `foldr (:) []` applied to any list?
- Implement `map` using `foldr`.

---

## Monoid

In the example fold above, we provide the `(+)` function to tell `foldl` how to aggregate elements of the list.  There is also a typeclass for things that are “automatically aggregatable” or “concatenatable” called `Monoid` which declares a general function for `mappend` combining two `Monoid`s into one, a `mempty` value such that any Monoid `mappend`ed with `mempty` is itself, and a concatenation function for lists of `Monoid` called `mconcat`.  

```haskell
Prelude> :i Monoid
class Semigroup a => Monoid a where
  mempty :: a
  mappend :: a -> a -> a
  mconcat :: [a] -> a
  {-# MINIMAL mempty #-}
...
```

In the `Data.Monoid` library there are some interesting instances of Monoid. For example `Sum` is an instance of Monoid which wraps a `Num`, such that lists of `Sum` can be `mconcat`ed:

```haskell
Prelude> import Data.Monoid
Data.Monoid> mconcat $ Sum <$> [5,8,3,1,7,6,2]
```

> Sum {getSum = 32}

So a sum is a data type with an accessor function getSum that we can use to get back the value:

```haskell
Prelude Data.Monoid> getSum $ mconcat $ Sum <$> [5,8,3,1,7,6,2]
```

> 32

We make a data type aggregatable by instancing `Monoid` and providing definitions for the functions `mappend` and `mempty`.  For `Sum` these will be `(+)` and `0` respectively.
Lists are also themselves Monoidal, with `mappend` defined as an alias for list concatenation `(++)`, and mempty as `[]`.  Thus, we can:

```haskell
Prelude Data.Monoid> mconcat [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

Which has a simple alias `concat` defined in the Prelude:

```haskell
Prelude> concat [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

There is also an operator for `mappend` called `(<>)`, such the following are equivalent:

```haskell
Data.Monoid> mappend (Sum 1) (Sum 2)
Sum {getSum = 3}

Data.Monoid> (Sum 1) <> (Sum 2)
Sum {getSum = 3}
```

And for lists (and `String`) we have:

```haskell
> mappend [1,2] [3,4]
[1,2,3,4]

> [1,2] <> [3,4]
[1,2,3,4]

> [1,2] ++ [3,4]
[1,2,3,4]
```

## Foldable

So now we’ve already been introduced to `foldl` and `foldr` for lists, and we’ve also seen the `Monoid` typeclass, let’s take a look at the general class of things that are `Foldable`.
As always, your best friend for exploring a new typeclass in Haskell is GHCi’s `:i` command:

```haskell
Prelude> :i Foldable
class Foldable (t :: * -> *) where
  foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> t a -> b -- as described previously, but notice foldr and foldl
  foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> t a -> b -- are for any Foldable t, not only lists
  length :: t a -> Int -- number of items stored in the Foldable
  null :: t a -> Bool -- True if empty
  elem :: Eq a => a -> t a -> Bool -- True if the a is an element of the t of a
  maximum :: Ord a => t a -> a -- biggest element in the Foldable
  minimum :: Ord a => t a -> a -- smallest element
  sum :: Num a => t a -> a -- compute the sum of a Foldable of Num
  product :: Num a => t a -> a -- compute the product of a Foldable of Num
  Data.Foldable.fold :: Monoid m => t m -> m -- if the elements of t are Monoids then we don’t need an operator to aggregate them
  foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> t a -> m -- uses the specified function to convert elements to Monoid and then folds them
  Data.Foldable.toList :: t a -> [a] -- convert any Foldable things to a list
  {-# MINIMAL foldMap | foldr #-}
        -- Defined in `Data.Foldable'
instance Foldable [] -- Defined in `Data.Foldable'
instance Foldable Maybe -- Defined in `Data.Foldable'
instance Foldable (Either a) -- Defined in `Data.Foldable'
instance Foldable ((,) a) -- Defined in `Data.Foldable'
```

Note that I’ve reordered the list of functions to the order we want to discuss them, removed a few things we’re not interested in at the moment and the comments are mine.
However, once you get used to reading types the `:info` for this class is pretty self explanatory.  Most of these functions are also familiar from their use with lists.  The surprise (OK, not really) is that lots of other things can be `Foldable` as well.

```haskell
Prelude> foldr (-) 1 (Just 3)
2
Prelude> foldl (-) 1 (Just 3)
-2
Prelude> foldr (+) 1 (Nothing)
1
Prelude> length (Just 3)
1
Prelude> length Nothing
0
-- etc
```

If we import the Data.Foldable namespace we also get `fold` and `foldMap`, which we can use with `Monoid` types which know how to aggregate themselves (with `mappend`):

```haskell
Prelude> import Data.Foldable

Prelude Data.Foldable> fold [[1,2],[3,4]] -- since lists are also Monoids
[1,2,3,4]
```

The fun really starts though now that we can make new `Foldable` things:

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty
            | Leaf a
            | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show)

tree = Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7))
```

Which produces a tree with this structure:

![Tree](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell4/tree.drawio.png)

We make this type of binary tree an instance of foldable by implementing either of the minimum defining functions, `foldMap` or `foldr`:

```haskell
instance Foldable Tree where
   foldMap :: Monoid m => (a -> m) -> Tree a -> m
   foldMap _ Empty = mempty
   foldMap f (Leaf x) = f x
   foldMap f (Node l x r) = foldMap f l <> f x <> foldMap f r

> length tree
7
> foldr (:) [] tree
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

We can use `foldMap` to map the values stored in the tree to an instance of `Monoid` and then concatenate these `Monoid`s.  For example, we could map and concatenate them as a `Sum`:
```haskell
> getSum $ foldMap Sum tree
28
```

Or we can compute the same conversion to a list as the above `foldr`, by providing `foldMap` with a function that places the values into singleton lists, e.g.:

```haskell
> (:[]) 1 -- cons 1 with an empty list, same as 1:[]
[1]
```

Since list is an instance of Monoid, `foldMap` will concatenate these singleton lists together:

```haskell
> foldMap (:[]) tree
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

----

### Exercises

- Make an instance of `Foldable` for `Tree` in terms of `foldr` instead of `foldMap`.

## Traversable

`Traversable` extends both `Foldable` and `Functor`, in a typeclass for things that we can `traverse` a function with an `Applicative` effect over. Here’s a sneak peak of what this lets us do:

```haskell
Prelude> traverse putStrLn ["tim","was","here"]
tim
was
here
[(),(),()]
```

The first three lines are the strings printed to the terminal (the side effect).  The result reported by GHCi is a list `[(),(),()]` as discussed below.

Here, as usual, is what GHCi `:i` tells us about the Traversable type class:

```haskell
Prelude> :i Traversable
class (Functor t, Foldable t) => Traversable (t :: * -> *) where
  traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
  sequenceA :: Applicative f => t (f a) -> f (t a)
  ... -- some other functions
  {-# MINIMAL traverse | sequenceA #-}
        -- Defined in `Data.Traversable'
instance Traversable [] -- Defined in `Data.Traversable'
instance Traversable Maybe -- Defined in `Data.Traversable'
instance Traversable (Either a) -- Defined in `Data.Traversable'
instance Traversable ((,) a) -- Defined in `Data.Traversable'
```

The following map shows how all of these typeclasses are starting to come together to offer some real power:

![Traversable Typeclasses](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell4/traversableTypeClasses.png)

So what does the traverse function do?  By way of example, remember our safe modulo function this we used to experiment with [Functor](/haskell3/#functor):
```haskell
safeMod :: Integral a => a-> a-> Maybe a
safeMod _ 0 = Nothing
safeMod numerator divisor = Just $ mod numerator divisor 
```

It lets us map over a list of numbers without throwing divide-by-zero exceptions:

```haskell
> map (safeMod 3) [1,2,0,2]
[Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 1]
```

But what if `0`s in the list really are indicative of disaster so that we should bail rather than proceeding?  The `traverse` function of the `Traversable` type-class gives us this kind of “all or nothing” capability:

```haskell
> traverse (safeMod 3) [1,2,0,2]
Nothing
> traverse (safeMod 3) [1,2,2]
Just [0,1,1]
```

So `map`ping a function with an `Applicative` effect over the values in a list gives us back a list with each of those values wrapped in the effect.  However, `traverse`ing such a function over a list gives us back the list of unwrapped values, with the whole list wrapped in the effect.

Traverse applies a function with a result in an `Applicative` context (i.e. an Applicative effect) to the contents of a `Traversable` thing.

```haskell
Prelude> :t traverse
traverse
  :: (Applicative f, Traversable t) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b) 
```

What are some other functions with Applicative effects?  Lots! E.g.:

- Any constructor of a data type that instances Applicative: e.g. `Just :: a -> Maybe a`
- Anything that creates a list: `(take 5 $ repeat 1) :: Num a => [a]`
- IO is Applicative, so a function like `print :: Show a => a -> IO ()`
- etc...

The `print` function converts values to strings (using show if available from an instance of `Show`) and sends them to standard-out.  The `print` function wraps this effect (there is an effect on the state of the console) in an `IO` computational context:

```haskell
Prelude> :t print
print :: Show a => a -> IO ()
```

The `()` is like `void` in TypeScript -- it’s a type with exactly one value `()`, and hence is called “Unit”.  There is no return value from `print`, only the `IO` effect, and hence the return type is `()`.  `IO` is also an instance of `Applicative`.  This means we can use `traverse` to print out the contents of a list:

```haskell
Prelude> traverse print [1,2,3]
1
2
3
[(),(),()]
```

Here `1,2,3` are printed to the console each on their own line (which is `print`’s IO effect), and `[(),(),()]` is the return value reported by GHCi -- a list of Unit.

```haskell
Prelude> :t traverse print [1,2,3]
traverse print [1,2,3] :: IO [()]
```

When we ran this at the REPL, GHCi consumed the `IO` effect (because it runs all commands inside the [`IO Monad`](/monad/)).  However, inside a pure function there is no easy way to get rid of this `IO` return type -- which protects you from creating `IO` effects unintentionally.

A related function defined in `Traversable` is `sequenceA` which allows us to convert directly from Traversables of Applicatives, to Applicatives of Traversables:

```haskell
> :t sequenceA
sequenceA :: (Applicative f, Traversable t) => t (f a) -> f (t a)
Prelude> sequenceA [Just 0,Just 1,Just 1]
Just [0,1,1]
Prelude> sequenceA [Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 1]
Nothing
```

The default `sequenceA` [is defined](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/src/Data.Traversable.html#sequenceA) very simply in terms of `traverse` (recall `id` is just `\x->x`):

```haskell
sequenceA = traverse id
```

A bit more fun with `sequenceA`, a list of functions:

```haskell
> :t [(+3),(*2),(+6)]
[(+3),(*2),(+6)] :: Num a => [a -> a]
```

is also a list of `Applicative`, because function `(->)r` is an instance of `Applicative`.  Therefore, we can apply `sequenceA` to a list of functions to make a single function that applies every function in the list to a given value and return a list of the results:

```haskell
> :t sequenceA [(+3),(*2),(+6)]
sequenceA [(+3),(*2),(+6)] :: Num a => a -> [a]
> sequenceA [(+3),(*2),(+6)] 2
[5,4,8]
```

To create our own instance of `Traversable` we need to implement `fmap` to make it a `Functor` and then either `foldMap` or `foldr` to make it `Foldable` and finally, either `traverse` or `sequenceA`.  So for our `Tree` type above, which we already made `Foldable` we add:

```haskell
instance Functor Tree where
   fmap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
   fmap _ Empty = Empty
   fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf $ f x
   fmap f (Node l v r) = Node (fmap f l) (f v) (fmap f r)

instance Traversable Tree where
   traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)
   traverse _ Empty = pure Empty
   traverse f (Leaf a) = Leaf <$> f a
   traverse f (Node l x r) = Node <$> traverse f l <*> f x <*> traverse f r
```

So now we can traverse a function with an `Applicative` effect over the tree:

```haskell
Prelude> traverse print tree
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

And of course, we can sequence a `Tree` of `Maybe`s into a `Maybe Tree`:

```haskell
> treeOfMaybes = Just <$> tree -- a tree of Maybes
> treeOfMaybes
Node (Node (Leaf (Just 1)) (Just 2) (Leaf (Just 3))) (Just 4) (Node (Leaf (Just 5)) (Just 6) (Leaf (Just 7)))
> sequenceA treeOfMaybes
Just (Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7)))
```

## Applying Functions Over Contexts

Thus far we have seen a variety of functions for applying functions in and over different contexts.  It is useful to note the similarities between these, and recognise that they are all doing conceptually the same thing, i.e. function application.  The difference is the in the type of context.  The simplest function for applying functions is the ($) operator, with just a function (no context), applied directly to a value.  Then `fmap`, just a function, mapped over a Functor context/container.  Then Applicative (function also in the context).  Then, most recently `traverse`: the function produces a result in an Applicative context, applied (traversed) over some data structure, and the resulting data structure returned in an Applicative context.  Below, I line up all the types so that the similarities and differences are as clear as possible.  It’s worth making sure at this stage that you can read such type signatures, as they really do summarise everything that we have discussed.

```haskell
($)      ::                                      (a -> b) -> a   -> b
(<$>)    :: Functor f                      =>    (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(<*>)    :: Applicative f                  =>  f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
traverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) =>  (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
```
## Parsing a String Using Traversable?

What if we want to parse an exact match for a given string, for example, a token in a programming language like the word `function`.  Or, to look for a polite greeting at the start of an email before deciding whether to respond, such as “hello”.

```haskell
> parse (string "hello") "hello world"
Just (" world", "hello")

> parse (string "hello") "world, hello"
Nothing
```

So the string “hello” is the prototype for the expected input.  How would we do this? 

Our parser would have to process characters from the input stream and check if each successive character  **is** the one expected from the prototype. 
If it is the correct character, we would cons it to our result and than parse the next character. 


This can be written using a `foldr` to parse all the characters while checking with the `is` parser.

```haskell
string l = foldr (\c acc -> liftA2 (:) (is c) acc) (pure "") l
```

Remembering `liftA2` is equivalent to `f <$> a <*> b`.

Our `<*>` will allow for the seqeuencing of the applicative effect, so this will sequentially parse all characters, making sure they are correct.
As soon, as one applicative parser fails, the result of the parsing will fail. 

This could also be written as:

```haskell
string l = foldr cons (pure []) l
  where
    cons c acc = liftA2 (:) (is c) acc
```

But the title of this section was traverse?

Well, lets consider how we would define a list as an instance of the traversable operator. The traverse function is defined [exactly](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.18.0.0/docs/src/Data.Traversable.html#traverse) as follows:

```haskell
instance Traversable [] where
    traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> [a] -> f [b]
    traverse f = foldr cons (pure [])
      where cons x ys = liftA2 (:) (f x) ys
```

This is almost exactly the definition of our string parser using `foldr` but the function `f` is exactly the `is` Parser.

Therefore, we can write `string = traverse is`

Let’s break down how the `string` parser using `traverse` and is works in terms of types:

```haskell
string :: String -> Parser String
string = traverse is
```

traverse is a higher-order function with the following type:

```haskell
traverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
```

`t` is a traversable data structure, which in our case is a `String` (since `String` is a list of characters).
`a` is the element type of the traversable structure, which is `Char` (the individual characters in the `String`).
`f` is an applicative functor, which is the `Parser` type in our case.
The function `(a -> f b)` is the parser for a single character. In our case, it’s the `is` parser.

So, we will apply the `is` function to each element in the the traversable `t` (the list) and store collect the result in to a `Parser [Char]`.

Therefore, `traverse is` is of type `Parser String`, which is a parser that attempts to parse the entire String and returns it as a result.


Can we also write this using `sequenceA`?

```haskell
string :: String -> Parser String
string str = sequenceA (map is str)
```

Or in point-free form

```haskell
string :: String -> Parser String
string = sequenceA . map is
```

`map is str` maps the is parser over each character in the input string `str`. This produces a list of parsers, where each parser checks if the corresponding character in the input matches the character in the target string.

sequenceA is then used to turn the list of parsers into a single parser. This function applies each parser to the input string and collects the results. If all character parsers succeed, it returns a list of characters; otherwise, it returns Nothing.

In fact an equivalent definition of traverse can be written using the sequenceA as follows:

```haskell
traverse :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
traverse f l = sequenceA (f <$> l)
```

---

### Exercises

- What would be the definition of sequenceA over a list? (without using traverse)
- Can you make the `Maybe` data type an instance of traversable?

---

## Bringing it all together!

We can also parse a tree by traversing a parser over it, the same way we parsed `string` by traversing a list of `Char`!

Recall from earlier in this section:

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty
            | Leaf a
            | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show)

instance Traversable Tree where
  --  traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> Tree a -> f (Tree b)
   traverse _ Empty = pure Empty
   traverse f (Leaf a) = Leaf <$> f a
   traverse f (Node l x r) = Node <$> traverse f l <*> f x <*> traverse f r
```

We can write a similar definition for parsing an exact tree compared to parsing a string!

We will consider a Value which is either an integer, or an operator which can combine integers. We will assume the only possible combination operator is `+` to avoid complexities with ordering expressions. 

```haskell

data Value = Value Int | BinaryPlus 
  deriving (Show)
```

We can generalize the `is` parser to `satisfy`, which will run a given parser `p`, and make sure the result satisfies a boolean condition.

```haskell
satisfy :: Parser a -> (a -> Bool) -> Parser a
satisfy p f = Parser $ \i -> case parse p i of 
  Just (r, v) 
      | f v -> Just (r, v)
  _ -> Nothing
```

From this satisfy, we will use traverse to ensure our string *exactly* matches a wanted expression Tree.

```haskell

isValue :: Value -> Parser Value
isValue (Value v) = Value <$> satisfy int (==v)
isValue BinaryPlus = BinaryPlus <$ satisfy char (=='+')

stringTree :: Tree Value -> Parser (Tree Value)
stringTree = traverse isValue

sampleTree :: Tree Value
sampleTree =
  Node
    (Leaf $ Value 3)
    BinaryPlus
    (Node
      (Leaf (Value 5))
      BinaryPlus
      (Leaf (Value 2)))


inputString :: String
inputString = "3+5+2"

parsedResult :: String -> Maybe (String, Tree Value)
parsedResult = parse (stringTree sampleTree) 
```

The parsedResult will only succeed if the input string exactly matches the desired tree.

To evaluate the parsed expression we can use foldMap and the Sum monoid:

```haskell
evalTree :: Tree Value -> Int
evalTree tree = getSum $ foldMap toSum tree
  where
    toSum :: Value -> Sum Int
    toSum (Value v) = Sum v
    toSum BinaryPlus = Sum 0 -- For BinaryPlus, we don’t need to add anything to the sum

evalResult :: Maybe (String, Int)
evalResult = (evalTree <$>) <$> parsedResult
-- >>> evalResult = Just ("", 10)
```

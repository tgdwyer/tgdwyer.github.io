## Learning Outcomes

- Define data structures using Haskell’s [Algebraic Data Types](#algebraic-data-types) and use [pattern matching](#pattern-matching) to define functions that handle each of the possible instances
- Use the alternate [record syntax](#record-syntax) to define data structures with named fields
- Understand that Haskell [type classes](#typeclasses) are similar to TypeScript interfaces in providing a definition for the set of functions that must be available for instances of those type classes and that typeclasses can extend upon one another to create rich hierarchies
- Understand that the [Maybe](#maybe) type provides an elegant way to handle *partial functions*.

## Algebraic Data Types

We can declare custom types for data in Haskell using the `data` keyword.  Consider the following declaration of our familiar cons list:

```haskell
data ConsList = Nil | Cons Int ConsList 
```

The `|` operator looks rather like the union type operator in TypeScript, and indeed it serves a similar purpose.  Here, a `ConsList` is defined as being a composite type, composed of either `Nil` or a `Cons` of an `Int` value and another `ConsList`.  This is called an “algebraic data type” because `|` is like an “or”, or algebraic “sum” operation for combining elements of the type while separating them with a space is akin to “and” or a “product” operation.  

Note that neither `Nil` or `Cons` are built in.  They are simply labels for constructor functions for the different versions of a `ConsList` node.  You could equally well call them `EndOfList` and `MakeList` or anything else that’s meaningful to you. `Nil` is a function with no parameters, `Cons` is a function with two parameters.  `Int` is a built-in primitive type for limited-precision integers.

Now we can create a small list like so:

```haskell
l = Cons 1 $ Cons 2 $ Cons 3 Nil  
```

## Pattern Matching

In Haskell, we can define multiple versions of a function to handle the instances of an algebraic data types.  This is done by providing a *pattern* in the parameter list of the function definition, in the form of an expression beginning with the constructor of the data instance (e.g. `Cons` or `Nil`) and variable names which will be bound to the different fields of the data instance.  

For example, we can create a function to determine a `ConsList`’s length using *pattern matching*; to not only create different definitions of the function for each of the possible instances of a `ConsList`, but also to destructure the non-empty `Cons`:

```haskell
consLength :: ConsList -> Int
consLength Nil = 0
consLength (Cons _ rest) = 1 + consLength rest 
```

Since we don’t care about the head value in this function, we match it with `_`, an unnamed variable, which effectively ignores it.  Note that another way to conditionally destructure with pattern matching is using a [case statement](/haskell1#conditional-code-constructs-cheatsheet).

Note that such a definition for lists is made completely redundant by Haskell’s wonderful built-in lists, where `[]` is the empty list, and `:` is an infix cons operator.  We can pattern match the empty list or destructure `(head:rest)`, e.g.:

```haskell
intListLength :: [Int] -> Int -- takes a list of Int as input and returns an Int
intListLength [] = 0
intListLength (_:rest) = 1 + intListLength rest 
```

## Type Parameters and Polymorphism

Similar to TypeScript Haskell provides *parametric polymorphism*.  That is, the type definitions for functions and data structures (defined with `data` like the `ConsList` above) can have type parameters (AKA type variables).  For example, the definition `intListLength` above is defined to only work with lists with `Int` elements.  This seems a silly restriction because in this function we don’t actually do anything with the elements themselves.  Below, we introduce the type parameter `a` so that the `length` function will able to work with lists of any type of elements.

```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int -- a is a type parameter
length [] = 0
length (_:rest) = 1 + length rest
```

The following visual summary shows pair data structures with accessor functions `fst` and `sec` defined using [Record Syntax](#record-syntax) with varying degrees of type flexibility, and compared with the equivalent [TypeScript generic notation](/typescript1#generic-types):

- Hard-coded for `Int` pairs only
- with one type parameter (by convention called `a` in Haskell, and `T` in TypeScript)
- with two type parameters such that the two elements may be different types

## Type Kinds

GHCi allows you to use the `:kind` (or `:k`) command to interrogate the *Kind* of types -- think of it as “meta information” about types and their type parameters.  The kind syntax indicates the *arity* or number of type parameters a type has.  Note that it is like the syntax for function types (with the `->`), you can think of it as information about what is required in terms of type parameters to instantiate the type.  If the constructor takes no type parameters the kind is just `*`, (it returns a type), `*->*` if it takes one type parameter, `*->*->*` for two type parameters and so on.

![Polymorphism Summary](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell2/kinds.png)

Another sort of “kind” are for [type classes](#typeclasses) which we will introduce more properly in a moment.
For example, the “kind” for the `Ord` type class (the class of things that are Orderable and which we came across in [our simple  implementation of quicksort](/haskell1#functional-programming-in-haskell-versus-javascript)) is:
```haskell
> :k Ord
Ord :: * -> Constraint
```
This tells us that `Ord` takes one type parameter (for example it could be an `Int` or other numeric type, or something more complex like the `Student` type below), and returns a `Constraint` rather than an actual type.  Such a constraint is used to narrow the set of types to which a function may be applied, just as we saw `Ord` being used as the type constraint for `sort`:

```haskell
> :t sort
sort :: Ord t => [t] -> [t]
```

## Record Syntax

Consider the following simple record data type: 

```haskell
data Student = Student Int String Int 
```

A `Student` has three fields, mysteriously typed `Int`, `String` and `Int`.  Let’s say my intention in creating the above data type was to store a student’s id, name and mark.  I would create a record like so:

```haskell
> t = Student 123 "Tim" 95
```

Here’s how one would search for the student with the best mark:

```haskell
best :: [Student] -> Student -> Student
best [] b = b
best (a@(Student _ _ am):rest) b@(Student _ _ bm) =
  if am > bm
  then best rest a
  else best rest b 
```

The `@` notation, as in `b@(Student _ _ bm)` stores the record itself in the variable b but also allows you to unpack its elements, e.g. `bm` is bound to mark.

To get the data out of a record I would need to either destructure using pattern matching, as above, every time, or create some accessor functions:

```haskell
id (Student n _ _) = n
name (Student _ n _) = n
mark (Student _ _ n) = n
> name t
"Tim" 
```

It’s starting to look a bit like annoying boilerplate code.  Luckily, Haskell has another way to define such record types, called record syntax:

```haskell
data Student = Student { id::Integer, name::String, mark::Int } 
```

This creates a record type in every way the same as the above, but the accessor functions `id`, `name` and `mark` are created automatically.

## Typeclasses

Haskell uses “type classes” as a way to associate functions with types.  A type class is like a promise that a certain type will have specific operations and functions available.  You can think of it as being similar to a [TypeScript interface](/typescript1#interfaces).

Despite the name however, it is not like an ES6/TypeScript class, since a Haskell type class does not actually give definitions for the functions themselves, only their type signatures.  
The function bodies are defined in “instances” of the type class.  A good starting point for gaining familiarity with type classes is seeing how they are used in the standard Haskell prelude.  From GHCi we can ask for information about a specific typeclass with the `:i` command, for example, `Num` is a typeclass common to numeric types:

```haskell
GHCi> :i Num
class Num a where   
  (+) :: a -> a -> a
  (-) :: a -> a -> a
  (*) :: a -> a -> a
  negate :: a -> a
  abs :: a -> a
  signum :: a -> a
  fromInteger :: Integer -> a
  {-# MINIMAL (+), (*), abs, signum, fromInteger, (negate | (-)) #-}
        -- Defined in `GHC.Num'
instance Num Word -- Defined in `GHC.Num'
instance Num Integer -- Defined in `GHC.Num'
instance Num Int -- Defined in `GHC.Num'
instance Num Float -- Defined in `GHC.Float'
instance Num Double -- Defined in `GHC.Float' 
```
The first line (beginning `class`) tells us that for a type to be an instance of the `Num` typeclass, it must provide the operators `+`, `*` and the functions `abs`, `signum` and `fromInteger`, and either `(-)` or `negate`.  The last is an option because a default definition exists for each in terms of the other.  The last five lines (beginning with “`instance`”) tell us which types have been declared as instances of `Num` and hence have definitions of the necessary functions.  These are `Word`, `Integer`, `Int`, `Float` and `Double`.  Obviously this is a much more finely grained set of types than JavaScript’s universal “`number`” type.  This granularity allows the type system to guard against improper use of numbers that might result in loss in precision or division by zero.

The main numeric type we will use in this course is `Int`, i.e. fixed-precision integers.

Note some obvious operations we would likely need to perform on numbers that are missing from the `Num` typeclass.  For example, equality checking.  This is defined in a separate type class `Eq`, that is also instanced by concrete numeric types like `Int`:
```haskell
> :i Eq
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  {-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}
...
instance Eq Int
... 
```

Note again that instances need implement only `==` or `/=` (not equal to), since each can be easily defined in terms of the other.  Still we are missing some obviously important operations, e.g., what about greater-than and less-than?  These are defined in the `Ord` type class:
```haskell
> :i Ord
class Eq a => Ord a where
  compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
  (<) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  max :: a -> a -> a
  min :: a -> a -> a
  {-# MINIMAL compare | (<=) #-} 
```

```haskell
-- The compare function returns an Ordering:
> :i Ordering
data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT 
```

A custom data type can be made an instance of `Ord` by implementing either `compare` or `<=`.  The definition `Eq a => Ord a` means that anything that is an instance of `Ord` must also be an instance of `Eq`.   Thus, typeclasses can build upon each other into rich hierarchies:

![Numeric Typeclasses](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell2/numericTypeClasses.png)

## Creating custom instances of type classes

If we have our own data types, how can we make standard operations like equality and inequality testing work with them?  Luckily, the most common type classes can easily be instanced automatically through the `deriving` keyword. For example, if we want to define a `Suit` type for a card game we can automatically generate default instances of the functions (and operators) associated with `Eq`uality testing, `Ord`inal comparisons, `Enum`erating the different possible values of the type, and `Show`ing them (or converting them to string):

```haskell
data Suit = Spade|Club|Diamond|Heart
 deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Show)

> Spade < Heart
True
```

The `Show` typeclass allows the data to be converted to strings with the `show` function (e.g. so that GHCi can display it).  The `Enum` typeclass allows enumeration, e.g.:

```haskell
> [Spade .. Heart]
[Spade,Club,Diamond,Heart]
```

We can also create custom instances of typeclasses by providing our own implementation of the necessary functions, e.g.:

```haskell
instance Show Suit where
 show Spade = "^"     -- OK, these characters are not
 show Club = "&"      -- brilliant approximations of the
 show Diamond = "O"   -- actual playing card symbols ♠ ♣ ♦ ♥
 show Heart = "V"     -- but GHCi support for unicode 
                      -- characters is a bit sketch
> [Spade .. Heart]
[^,&,O,V]
```

## Maybe

Another important built-in type is `Maybe`:

```haskell
> :i Maybe
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

All the functions we have considered so far are assumed to be *total*.  That is, the function provides a mapping for every element in the input type to an element in the output type.  `Maybe` allows us to have a sensible return-type for *partial* functions, that is, functions which do not have a mapping for every input:

![Total and Partial Functions](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell2/partialFunctions.png)

For example, the built-in function `lookup` can be used to search a list of key-value pairs, and fail gracefully by returning `Nothing` if there is no matching key.

```haskell
phonebook :: [(String, String)]
phonebook = [ ("Bob",   "01788 665242"), ("Fred",  "01624 556442"), ("Alice", "01889 985333") ]

> :t lookup
lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b

> lookup "Fred" phonebook
Just "01624 556442"

> lookup "Tim" phonebook
Nothing
```

We can use pattern matching to extract values from a `Maybe` (when we have `Just` a value), or to perform some sensible default behaviour when we have `Nothing`.
```haskell
printNumber name = msg $ lookup name phonebook
where
   msg (Just number)  = print number
   msg Nothing        = print $ name ++ " not found in database"

*GHCi> printNumber "Fred"
"01624 556442"
*GHCi> printNumber "Tim"
"Tim not found in database"
```
